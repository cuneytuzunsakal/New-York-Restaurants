The aim of this project is to develop a dashboard that empowers restaurant owners and chain management to strategically identify optimal locations for opening new branches. 
This dashboard will leverage a combination of data-driven criteria, 
including minimizing rent costs and crime rates, maximizing population density, optimizing competition levels, and aligning with target demographics. 
By providing precise location recommendations based on these factors, the project aims to enhance the decision-making process 
and increase the chances of success for new restaurant or cafe branches, ultimately contributing to the growth and profitability of the business.
